Nothing in this section shall preclude any such constitutional officer or head of such agency from establishing and enforcing additional standards of conduct.  \r\n\r\n(f) The state ethics commission shall adopt regulations: (i) defining substantial value; provided, however, that substantial value shall not be less than $50; (ii) establishing exclusions for ceremonial privileges and exemptions; (iii) establishing exclusions for privileges and exemptions given solely because of family or friendship; and (iv) establishing additional exclusions for other situations that do not present a genuine risk of a conflict or the appearance of a conflict of interest.   \r\n\r\n""]","Section 1.

''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau.

The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs.

Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs.

If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law.

Programs shall be sufficiently flexible to serve families with various work schedules. The department shall develop a method for funding the program, which may provide grants, or enter into contracts with any provider of early education and care, or entities coordinating or administering plans to provide high-quality, comprehensive services to children and their families within the local community. These providers may include, but are not limited to: public; private; non-profit and for-profit preschools; child care centers; nursery schools; preschools operating within public and private schools; Head Start programs; independent and system-affiliated family child care homes; and local early education and care councils.

The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  \r\n\r\n(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe department shall include its findings and recommendations, and any updates of its findings, in the annual report required under section 3.   \r\n\r\nSection 2.

The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual.

A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7.

The authorized members may vote and shall not be deemed absent for the purposes of section 23D of chapter 39.  \r\n\r\n(e) A local commission on disability may by majority vote of the commissioners at a regular meeting authorize remote participation applicable to a specific meeting or generally to all of the commission's meetings. If a local commission on disability is authorized to utilize remote participation, a physical quorum of that commission's members shall not be required to be present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the chair or, in the chair's absence, the person authorized to chair the meeting, shall be physically present at the meeting location. The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  \r\n\r\n(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting.

Unless otherwise directed or approved by the attorney general, the appointing authority, city or town clerk or the executive director or other appropriate administrator of a state or regional body, or their designees, shall obtain certification from each person upon entering service and shall retain it subject to the applicable records retention schedule where the body maintains its official records. The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2.

To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9.

Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure.

A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards.

The collective bargaining process and the grievance procedures described in said chapter 150E including section 8 of said chapter 150E, shall not apply to the department's statutory and regulatory licensing, monitoring and enforcement functions or to the contractual arrangements and reimbursements between the department and family child care systems as defined in section 1A of chapter 15D.  \r\n\r\n(k) Collective bargaining and related activity by providers, as authorized under this section, shall qualify for the state action exemption to the federal anti-trust laws.   \r\n\r\nSection 18.

Preference may be given to projects that have suffered partial or complete damage to an eligible facility from a natural or man-made disaster.  \r\n\r\n(c) There shall be within the department a separate fund to be known as the Early Education and Out of School Time Capital Fund. The department shall administer the fund for the purpose of making grants for the development of eligible facilities for licensed early care and education and out of school time programs; provided however that the department may contract with 1 or more quasi-public or non-profit entities to administer the program, including, but not limited to, the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation established in chapter 40H.   \r\n\r\nSection 20. (a) Except as provided in section 21, all meetings of a public body shall be open to the public.  \r\n\r\n(b) Except in an emergency, in addition to any notice otherwise required by law, a public body shall post notice of every meeting at least 48 hours prior to the meeting, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. In an emergency, a public body shall post notice as soon as reasonably possible prior to the meeting. Notice shall be printed in a legible, easily understandable format and shall contain the date, time and place of the meeting and a listing of topics that the chair reasonably anticipates will be discussed at the meeting.  \r\n\r\n(c) For meetings of a local public body, notice shall be filed with the municipal clerk and posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in or on the municipal building in which the clerk's office is located.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a regional or district public body, notice shall be filed and posted in each city or town within the region or district in the manner prescribed for local public bodies.

For meetings of a county public body, notice shall be filed in the office of the county commissioners and a copy of the notice shall be publicly posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in the places as the county commissioners shall designate for the purpose.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a state public body, notice shall be filed with the attorney general by posting on a website under the procedures established for this purpose and a duplicate copy of the notice shall be filed with the regulations division in the state secretary's office.  \r\n\r\nThe attorney general may prescribe or approve alternative methods of notice where the attorney general determines the alternative methods will afford more effective notice to the public.  \r\n\r\n(d) The attorney general may, by regulation or letter ruling, authorize remote participation by members of a public body not present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the absent members and all persons present at the meeting location are clearly audible to each other; and provided further, that a quorum of the body, including the chair, are present at the meeting location. The authorized members may vote and shall not be deemed absent for the purposes of section 23D of chapter 39.  \r\n\r\n(e) A local commission on disability may by majority vote of the commissioners at a regular meeting authorize remote participation applicable to a specific meeting or generally to all of the commission's meetings. If a local commission on disability is authorized to utilize remote participation, a physical quorum of that commission's members shall not be required to be present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the chair or, in the chair's absence, the person authorized to chair the meeting, shall be physically present at the meeting location. The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  \r\n\r\n(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the chair shall inform other attendees of any recordings.  \r\n\r\n(g) No person shall address a meeting of a public body without permission of the chair, and all persons shall, at the request of the chair, be silent. No person shall disrupt the proceedings of a meeting of a public body. If, after clear warning from the chair, a person continues to disrupt the proceedings, the chair may order the person to withdraw from the meeting and if the person does not withdraw, the chair may authorize a constable or other officer to remove the person from the meeting.  \r\n\r\n(h) Within 2 weeks of qualification for office, all persons serving on a public body shall certify, on a form prescribed by the attorney general, the receipt of a copy of the open meeting law, regulations promulgated under section 25 and a copy of the educational materials prepared by the attorney general explaining the open meeting law and its application under section 19. Unless otherwise directed or approved by the attorney general, the appointing authority, city or town clerk or the executive director or other appropriate administrator of a state or regional body, or their designees, shall obtain certification from each person upon entering service and shall retain it subject to the applicable records retention schedule where the body maintains its official records. The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  \r\n\r\n(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  \r\n\r\n(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  \r\n\r\n10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.  \r\n\r\n(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  \r\n\r\n1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  \r\n\r\n2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;  \r\n\r\n3. before the executive session, the chair shall state the purpose for the executive session, stating all subjects that may be revealed without compromising the purpose for which the executive session was called;  \r\n\r\n4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  \r\n\r\n5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   \r\n\r\nSection 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  \r\n\r\n(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  \r\n\r\n(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  \r\n\r\n(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  \r\n\r\n(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  \r\n\r\n(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   \r\n\r\nSection 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  \r\n\r\nWhen, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards. The bureau may conduct quality assurance reviews of provider financial statements and their auditors' reports and work papers. The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  \r\n\r\nThe assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  \r\n\r\nAll proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law.

For meetings of a county public body, notice shall be filed in the office of the county commissioners and a copy of the notice shall be publicly posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in the places as the county commissioners shall designate for the purpose.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a state public body, notice shall be filed with the attorney general by posting on a website under the procedures established for this purpose and a duplicate copy of the notice shall be filed with the regulations division in the state secretary's office.  \r\n\r\nThe attorney general may prescribe or approve alternative methods of notice where the attorney general determines the alternative methods will afford more effective notice to the public.  \r\n\r\n(d) The attorney general may, by regulation or letter ruling, authorize remote participation by members of a public body not present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the absent members and all persons present at the meeting location are clearly audible to each other; and provided further, that a quorum of the body, including the chair, are present at the meeting location. The authorized members may vote and shall not be deemed absent for the purposes of section 23D of chapter 39.  \r\n\r\n(e) A local commission on disability may by majority vote of the commissioners at a regular meeting authorize remote participation applicable to a specific meeting or generally to all of the commission's meetings. If a local commission on disability is authorized to utilize remote participation, a physical quorum of that commission's members shall not be required to be present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the chair or, in the chair's absence, the person authorized to chair the meeting, shall be physically present at the meeting location. The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  \r\n\r\n(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the chair shall inform other attendees of any recordings.  \r\n\r\n(g) No person shall address a meeting of a public body without permission of the chair, and all persons shall, at the request of the chair, be silent. No person shall disrupt the proceedings of a meeting of a public body. If, after clear warning from the chair, a person continues to disrupt the proceedings, the chair may order the person to withdraw from the meeting and if the person does not withdraw, the chair may authorize a constable or other officer to remove the person from the meeting.  \r\n\r\n(h) Within 2 weeks of qualification for office, all persons serving on a public body shall certify, on a form prescribed by the attorney general, the receipt of a copy of the open meeting law, regulations promulgated under section 25 and a copy of the educational materials prepared by the attorney general explaining the open meeting law and its application under section 19. Unless otherwise directed or approved by the attorney general, the appointing authority, city or town clerk or the executive director or other appropriate administrator of a state or regional body, or their designees, shall obtain certification from each person upon entering service and shall retain it subject to the applicable records retention schedule where the body maintains its official records. The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  \r\n\r\n(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  \r\n\r\n(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  \r\n\r\n10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.  \r\n\r\n(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  \r\n\r\n1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  \r\n\r\n2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;  \r\n\r\n3. before the executive session, the chair shall state the purpose for the executive session, stating all subjects that may be revealed without compromising the purpose for which the executive session was called;  \r\n\r\n4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  \r\n\r\n5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   \r\n\r\nSection 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  \r\n\r\n(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  \r\n\r\n(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  \r\n\r\n(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  \r\n\r\n(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  \r\n\r\n(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   \r\n\r\nSection 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  \r\n\r\nWhen, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   \r\n\r\nSection 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  \r\n\r\n(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  \r\n\r\n(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  \r\n\r\n(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  \r\n\r\n(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards. In developing the benchmarks, the department shall collaborate with pediatricians, child psychologists, and researchers within the field of child development and developmental psychology, in order to ensure that the document reflects best practices in the field and the most recent evidence provided by science relative to early childhood development.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards. The bureau may conduct quality assurance reviews of provider financial statements and their auditors' reports and work papers. The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  \r\n\r\nThe assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  \r\n\r\nAll proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.   \r\n\r\nSection 1A.

The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  \r\n\r\n(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  \r\n\r\n(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  \r\n\r\n10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.  \r\n\r\n(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  \r\n\r\n1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  \r\n\r\n2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;  \r\n\r\n3. before the executive session, the chair shall state the purpose for the executive session, stating all subjects that may be revealed without compromising the purpose for which the executive session was called;  \r\n\r\n4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  \r\n\r\n5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   \r\n\r\nSection 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  \r\n\r\n(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  \r\n\r\n(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  \r\n\r\n(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  \r\n\r\n(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  \r\n\r\n(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   \r\n\r\nSection 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  \r\n\r\nWhen, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   \r\n\r\nSection 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  \r\n\r\n(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  \r\n\r\n(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  \r\n\r\n(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  \r\n\r\n(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards. In developing the benchmarks, the department shall collaborate with pediatricians, child psychologists, and researchers within the field of child development and developmental psychology, in order to ensure that the document reflects best practices in the field and the most recent evidence provided by science relative to early childhood development.   \r\n\r\nSection 19. (a) When designing or acquiring an electronic record keeping system or database, records access officers shall, consistent with section 17 of chapter 110G, consult with their chief executive officer, chief administrative officer or the Massachusetts office of information technology pursuant to chapter 7D to ensure, to the extent feasible, that the system or database is capable of providing data in a commonly available electronic, machine readable format. Such database designs or acquisitions shall allow for, to the extent feasible, information storage and retrieval methods that permit the segregation and retrieval of public records and redacting of exempt information in order to provide maximum public access. No agency or municipality shall enter into a contract for the storage of electronic records containing public records if the contract prevents or unduly restricts the records access officer from providing the public records in accordance with this chapter.  \r\n\r\n(b) Every agency shall provide on a searchable website electronic copies, accessible in a commonly available electronic format, of the following types of records, provided that any agency may withhold any record or portion thereof in accordance with state or federal law:  \r\n\r\n(i) final opinions, decisions, orders, or votes from agency proceedings;  \r\n\r\n(ii) annual reports;  \r\n\r\n(iii) notices of regulations proposed under chapter 30A;  \r\n\r\n(iv) notices of hearings;  \r\n\r\n(v) winning bids for public contracts;  \r\n\r\n(vi) awards of federal, state and municipal government grants;  \r\n\r\n(vii) minutes of open meetings;  \r\n\r\n(viii) agency budgets; and  \r\n\r\n(ix) any public record information of significant interest that the agency deems appropriate to post.   \r\n\r\n""]","Section 22N.

The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

For the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.

The bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  

The bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  

The bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

The prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  

The bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.

The assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.

The bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  

The bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.

Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.

The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  

The assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.

The bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  

The bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.

The policy shall be research-based, and aligned with best practices. The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  

(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.

No rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation.

The state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   

Section 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  

(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual.

7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  

8.

When the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

For purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure.

A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   

 Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

For the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  

The bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  

The bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  

The bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

The prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body.

Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  

No rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  

Prior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  

(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  

(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  

(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  

The state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.

(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual.

The rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.

7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  

8.

(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  

1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  

2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;

4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  

5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   

Section 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  

(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  

(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.

Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  

(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  

When the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

For purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  

(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   

Section 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  

When a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  

When a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  

When, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   

 Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

For the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  

The bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  

The bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  

The bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

The prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  

The bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  

A provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  

The bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards. The bureau may conduct quality assurance reviews of provider financial statements and their auditors' reports and work papers. The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  

The assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  

All proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  

The bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  

The bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.

For purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  

(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   

Section 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  

When a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  

When a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  

When, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   

Section 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  

(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  

(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  

(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  

(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards. In developing the benchmarks, the department shall collaborate with pediatricians, child psychologists, and researchers within the field of child development and developmental psychology, in order to ensure that the document reflects best practices in the field and the most recent evidence provided by science relative to early childhood development.   

Section 19. (a) When designing or acquiring an electronic record keeping system or database, records access officers shall, consistent with section 17 of chapter 110G, consult with their chief executive officer, chief administrative officer or the Massachusetts office of information technology pursuant to chapter 7D to ensure, to the extent feasible, that the system or database is capable of providing data in a commonly available electronic, machine readable format. Such database designs or acquisitions shall allow for, to the extent feasible, information storage and retrieval methods that permit the segregation and retrieval of public records and redacting of exempt information in order to provide maximum public access. No agency or municipality shall enter into a contract for the storage of electronic records containing public records if the contract prevents or unduly restricts the records access officer from providing the public records in accordance with this chapter.  

(b) Every agency shall provide on a searchable website electronic copies, accessible in a commonly available electronic format, of the following types of records, provided that any agency may withhold any record or portion thereof in accordance with state or federal law:  

(i) final opinions, decisions, orders, or votes from agency proceedings;  

(ii) annual reports;  

(iii) notices of regulations proposed under chapter 30A;  

(iv) notices of hearings;  

(v) winning bids for public contracts;  

(vi) awards of federal, state and municipal government grants;  

(vii) minutes of open meetings;  

(viii) agency budgets; and

Any city or town in which total taxes exceed this limit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\n[There is no paragraph (c).]  \r\n\r\n(d) Any city or town in which total taxes assessed exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (b) shall for each successive year until the total taxes assessed shall not exceed said limits, reduce the total taxes assessed by not less than fifteen per cent of the total taxes assessed for the year immediately preceding; provided, however, that the reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall not be so great as to require a reduction below the limits set forth in paragraph (b); and provided, further, that said reduction may be adjusted by those amounts approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e).  \r\n\r\n(e) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (d) by a specified amount. Any question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''.      \r\n\r\nIf the amount specified in such question is not greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''. If the amount specified is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if two-thirds of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIn no event shall the amount specified be greater than the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\nThe local appropriating authority may, by a two-thirds vote, submit two questions on the same ballot; provided that only one question shall specify an amount which is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (d). If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  \r\n\r\n(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  \r\n\r\n(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.  \r\n\r\nAny question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''      \r\n\r\nSaid question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIf a question as aforesaid shall provide for assessing taxes for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund established pursuant to section 5B of chapter 40, the assessors shall in each successive fiscal year assess property taxes for the same purpose in an amount equal to 102.5 per cent of the amount assessed in the next preceding year in which additional taxes were assessed for such purpose, but only if the local appropriating authority votes by a 2/3 vote to appropriate such increased amount in such year for such purpose. The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  \r\n\r\n(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section. The question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be required to reduce the amount of real estate and personal property taxes to be assessed for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___ by an amount equal to $___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''.      \r\n\r\nIf a majority of the persons voting on the question shall vote ''yes'', the limit on total taxes assessed shall be decreased to the percentage so voted for that fiscal year.  \r\n\r\n(i) With regard to the referenda procedures set out in this section the local appropriating authority may direct that the questions be placed upon the official ballot at a regular city or town election or at a special election which the local appropriating authority may call at any time. The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.  \r\n\r\n(i1/2) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the levy limitation for certain capital outlay expenditures. Amounts for such capital outlay expenditures or for the city's or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit shall be assessed only after approval by a separate vote of the people taken at a regular or special election held before the setting of the annual tax rate; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be worded as follows: ''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, two thousand and ___?

In the case of a city or town whose water and sewer service is provided by an independent commission, authority or district which separately bills water and sewer users, said commission, authority or district may enter into an agreement with said city or town to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph, provided, however, that immediately upon collection of all such taxes assessed for payment of such residential water and sewer debt service charges of such commission, authority or district, the treasurer or collector of taxes of such city or town shall, without appropriation by such city or town, pay over the taxes so collected to such commission, authority or district less any amounts agreed upon to provide reasonable compensation to the city or town for costs incurred in carrying out the agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter twenty-nine C, chapter two hundred and seventy-five of the acts of nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, or any other general or special law to the contrary, any city or town which accepts this paragraph or any independent authority, commission or district which provides water or sewer services to such city or town shall remain eligible to receive loans and grants for water pollution abatement projects or safe drinking water projects.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 10. The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  \r\n\r\n(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  \r\n\r\n(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  \r\n\r\n(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  \r\n\r\n(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   \r\n \r\nIncome                                                                                                            \r\n\r\n(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             \r\n\r\n(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     \r\n\r\n(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  \r\n\r\n(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  \r\n\r\n(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.   \r\n\r\nSection 21C.

If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  \r\n\r\n(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  \r\n\r\n(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.  \r\n\r\nAny question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''      \r\n\r\nSaid question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIf a question as aforesaid shall provide for assessing taxes for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund established pursuant to section 5B of chapter 40, the assessors shall in each successive fiscal year assess property taxes for the same purpose in an amount equal to 102.5 per cent of the amount assessed in the next preceding year in which additional taxes were assessed for such purpose, but only if the local appropriating authority votes by a 2/3 vote to appropriate such increased amount in such year for such purpose. The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose.

The advisory board shall meet at least quarterly.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 10. The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  \r\n\r\n(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  \r\n\r\n(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  \r\n\r\n(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  \r\n\r\n(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   \r\n \r\nIncome                                                                                                            \r\n\r\n(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             \r\n\r\n(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  \r\n\r\nThe Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     \r\n\r\n(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  \r\n\r\n(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  \r\n\r\n(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.   \r\n\r\nSection 21C.

Any city or town in which total taxes exceed this limit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\n[There is no paragraph (c).]  \r\n\r\n(d) Any city or town in which total taxes assessed exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (b) shall for each successive year until the total taxes assessed shall not exceed said limits, reduce the total taxes assessed by not less than fifteen per cent of the total taxes assessed for the year immediately preceding; provided, however, that the reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall not be so great as to require a reduction below the limits set forth in paragraph (b); and provided, further, that said reduction may be adjusted by those amounts approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e).  \r\n\r\n(e) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (d) by a specified amount. Any question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''.      \r\n\r\nIf the amount specified in such question is not greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''. If the amount specified is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if two-thirds of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIn no event shall the amount specified be greater than the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\nThe local appropriating authority may, by a two-thirds vote, submit two questions on the same ballot; provided that only one question shall specify an amount which is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (d). If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  \r\n\r\n(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  \r\n\r\n(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.  \r\n\r\nAny question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''      \r\n\r\nSaid question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIf a question as aforesaid shall provide for assessing taxes for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund established pursuant to section 5B of chapter 40, the assessors shall in each successive fiscal year assess property taxes for the same purpose in an amount equal to 102.5 per cent of the amount assessed in the next preceding year in which additional taxes were assessed for such purpose, but only if the local appropriating authority votes by a 2/3 vote to appropriate such increased amount in such year for such purpose. The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  \r\n\r\n(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section. The question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be required to reduce the amount of real estate and personal property taxes to be assessed for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___ by an amount equal to $___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''.      \r\n\r\nIf a majority of the persons voting on the question shall vote ''yes'', the limit on total taxes assessed shall be decreased to the percentage so voted for that fiscal year.  \r\n\r\n(i) With regard to the referenda procedures set out in this section the local appropriating authority may direct that the questions be placed upon the official ballot at a regular city or town election or at a special election which the local appropriating authority may call at any time. The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.  \r\n\r\n(i1/2) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the levy limitation for certain capital outlay expenditures. Amounts for such capital outlay expenditures or for the city's or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit shall be assessed only after approval by a separate vote of the people taken at a regular or special election held before the setting of the annual tax rate; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be worded as follows: ''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, two thousand and ___?

Any city or town in which total taxes exceed this limit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\n[There is no paragraph (c).]  \r\n\r\n(d) Any city or town in which total taxes assessed exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (b) shall for each successive year until the total taxes assessed shall not exceed said limits, reduce the total taxes assessed by not less than fifteen per cent of the total taxes assessed for the year immediately preceding; provided, however, that the reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall not be so great as to require a reduction below the limits set forth in paragraph (b); and provided, further, that said reduction may be adjusted by those amounts approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e).  \r\n\r\n(e) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (d) by a specified amount. Any question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''.      \r\n\r\nIf the amount specified in such question is not greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''. If the amount specified is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if two-thirds of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIn no event shall the amount specified be greater than the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d).  \r\n\r\nThe local appropriating authority may, by a two-thirds vote, submit two questions on the same ballot; provided that only one question shall specify an amount which is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (d). If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  \r\n\r\n(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  \r\n\r\n(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.  \r\n\r\nAny question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  \r\n\r\n''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  \r\n\r\nYES        NO    ''      \r\n\r\nSaid question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  \r\n\r\nIf a question as aforesaid shall provide for assessing taxes for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund established pursuant to section 5B of chapter 40, the assessors shall in each successive fiscal year assess property taxes for the same purpose in an amount equal to 102.5 per cent of the amount assessed in the next preceding year in which additional taxes were assessed for such purpose, but only if the local appropriating authority votes by a 2/3 vote to appropriate such increased amount in such year for such purpose. The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  \r\n\r\n(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section.

The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.  \r\n\r\n(i1/2) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the levy limitation for certain capital outlay expenditures. Amounts for such capital outlay expenditures or for the city's or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit shall be assessed only after approval by a separate vote of the people taken at a regular or special election held before the setting of the annual tax rate; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be worded as follows: ''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, two thousand and ___?

(a) There shall be a foundation budget for the school district in each municipality, regional school district, independent vocational school and vocational school and agricultural school operated by a county.  \r\n\r\nThe foundation budget shall be calculated based on each district's foundation enrollment for the prior fiscal year. Foundation budgets shall be based on the per pupil amounts in table 1 and the foundation increment amounts in table 2; provided, however, that the special education in-school and special education tuitioned-out enrollments shall be assumed enrollments.

The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  

(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  

(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  

(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  

(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  

The Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   
 
Income                                                                                                            

(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  

The Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             

(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  

The Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     

(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  

(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  

In the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  

(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.

Said question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  

If a question as aforesaid shall provide for assessing taxes for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund established pursuant to section 5B of chapter 40, the assessors shall in each successive fiscal year assess property taxes for the same purpose in an amount equal to 102.5 per cent of the amount assessed in the next preceding year in which additional taxes were assessed for such purpose, but only if the local appropriating authority votes by a 2/3 vote to appropriate such increased amount in such year for such purpose. The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  

(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section. The question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  

''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be required to reduce the amount of real estate and personal property taxes to be assessed for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___ by an amount equal to $___?  

YES        NO    ''.      

If a majority of the persons voting on the question shall vote ''yes'', the limit on total taxes assessed shall be decreased to the percentage so voted for that fiscal year.  

(i) With regard to the referenda procedures set out in this section the local appropriating authority may direct that the questions be placed upon the official ballot at a regular city or town election or at a special election which the local appropriating authority may call at any time. The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.  

(i1/2) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the levy limitation for certain capital outlay expenditures. Amounts for such capital outlay expenditures or for the city's or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit shall be assessed only after approval by a separate vote of the people taken at a regular or special election held before the setting of the annual tax rate; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be worded as follows: ''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, two thousand and ___?

(j) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval at a regular or special election to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to this section for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness, excluding tax revenue anticipation notes, issued by the city or town and for the city's or town's apportioned share of the principal and interest on such bonds or notes issued by a regional governmental unit which were outstanding as of November fourth, nineteen hundred and eighty; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be as follows:&mdash;  

''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to exempt the total amounts required to pay for bonded indebtedness incurred prior to the passage of proposition two and one-half, so-called, from the (city's/town's) limit?  

Yes        No    '';      

and provided, further, that said question shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  

(k) The local appropriating authority of any city or town may, by two-thirds vote, seek voter approval at a regular or special election to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to this section for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness, excluding tax revenue anticipation notes, issued by the city or town and for the city's or town's apportioned share of the principal and interest on such bonds or notes issued by a regional governmental unit which were not outstanding as of November fourth, nineteen hundred and eighty; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be as follows:&mdash;

(l) Amounts exempted from the tax limit under paragraph (i1/2), (j), (k) or (n) shall not be included in calculating the ''total taxes assessed'' in paragraph (a) or the maximum levy limit in paragraph (f).  

(m) A town may appropriate from the tax levy, from available funds, or from borrowing, contingent on the passage of a ballot question under paragraph (g), (i1/2) or (k), but: (1) the statement of the purpose of the appropriation shall be substantially the same as the statement of purpose in the ballot question; (2) the appropriation vote shall not be deemed to take effect until the approval of the ballot question; (3) no election at which the question appears on the ballot shall take place later than the September 15 following the date of an appropriation vote adopted at an annual town meeting, or 90 days after the date of the close of any other town meeting at which an appropriation vote was adopted; and (4) after a contingent appropriation from the tax levy, a tax rate for a town shall not be submitted for certification by the commissioner under section 23 until after a ballot question under paragraph (g), (i1/2) or (k) has been voted upon, or until the expiration of the time for holding an election at which the question appears on the ballot, whichever period is shorter.  

(n) The local appropriating authority may, by accepting this paragraph, provide that taxes may thereafter be assessed in excess of the amount otherwise allowed by this section, solely for payment, in whole or in part, of water or sewer debt service charges, including debt service charges of an independent commission, authority or district and as part of any wholesale water and sewer charges, that the board or officer responsible for determining the water and sewer charges certifies were not in fiscal year nineteen hundred and ninety-three paid by local taxes; provided, however, that water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such aggregate additional taxes assessed; and provided, further, that said additional taxes may be assessed on only residential real property as defined in section two A, notwithstanding the failure of the city or town to adopt a residential factor pursuant to section fifty-six of chapter forty, but subject to any subsequent adoption of such residential factor allowed by said section fifty-six; and provided, further, that if said additional taxes are assessed only on residential real property, aggregate residential water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such additional taxes assessed. In the case of a city or town whose water and sewer service is provided by an independent commission, authority or district which separately bills water and sewer users, said commission, authority or district may enter into an agreement with said city or town to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph, provided, however, that immediately upon collection of all such taxes assessed for payment of such residential water and sewer debt service charges of such commission, authority or district, the treasurer or collector of taxes of such city or town shall, without appropriation by such city or town, pay over the taxes so collected to such commission, authority or district less any amounts agreed upon to provide reasonable compensation to the city or town for costs incurred in carrying out the agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter twenty-nine C, chapter two hundred and seventy-five of the acts of nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, or any other general or special law to the contrary, any city or town which accepts this paragraph or any independent authority, commission or district which provides water or sewer services to such city or town shall remain eligible to receive loans and grants for water pollution abatement projects or safe drinking water projects.   

 Section 10. The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  

(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  

(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  

(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  

(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  

The Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   
 
Income                                                                                                            

(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  

The Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             

(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  

The Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     

(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  

(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  

In the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  

(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.   

Section 21C. (a) Whenever used in the text of this section, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings:&mdash;  

''Full and fair cash valuation'', the fair cash value of all real estate and personal property as defined in this chapter, as certified by the commissioner, or, if no certification has been made, as last reported by the commissioner to the general court pursuant to section ten C of chapter fifty-eight as updated by the commissioner for any intervening period by an appropriate factor, if any.

The local appropriating authority may, by a two-thirds vote, submit two questions on the same ballot; provided that only one question shall specify an amount which is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (d). If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  

(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  

(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.

The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  

(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section.

If a majority of the persons voting on the question shall vote ''yes'', the limit on total taxes assessed shall be decreased to the percentage so voted for that fiscal year.  

(i) With regard to the referenda procedures set out in this section the local appropriating authority may direct that the questions be placed upon the official ballot at a regular city or town election or at a special election which the local appropriating authority may call at any time. The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.

The advisory board shall meet at least quarterly.   

 Section 10. The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  

(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  

(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  

(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  

(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  

The Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   
 
Income                                                                                                            

(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  

The Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             

(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  

The Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     

(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  

(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  

In the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  

(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.   

Section 21C. (a) Whenever used in the text of this section, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings:&mdash;  

''Full and fair cash valuation'', the fair cash value of all real estate and personal property as defined in this chapter, as certified by the commissioner, or, if no certification has been made, as last reported by the commissioner to the general court pursuant to section ten C of chapter fifty-eight as updated by the commissioner for any intervening period by an appropriate factor, if any.  

''Local appropriating authority'', in a town, the board of selectmen; in a city, the council, with the mayor's approval when required by law; in a municipality having a town council form of government, the town council.

(b) The total taxes assessed within any city or town under the provisions of this chapter shall not exceed two and one-half per cent of the full and fair cash valuation in said city or town in any fiscal year. Any city or town in which total taxes exceed this limit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (d).  

[There is no paragraph (c).]  

(d) Any city or town in which total taxes assessed exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (b) shall for each successive year until the total taxes assessed shall not exceed said limits, reduce the total taxes assessed by not less than fifteen per cent of the total taxes assessed for the year immediately preceding; provided, however, that the reduction pursuant to this paragraph shall not be so great as to require a reduction below the limits set forth in paragraph (b); and provided, further, that said reduction may be adjusted by those amounts approved in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e).  

(e) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) may, by a two-thirds vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of the amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (d) by a specified amount. Any question submitted to the voters shall be worded as follows:&mdash;  

''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and ___?  

YES        NO    ''.      

If the amount specified in such question is not greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if a majority of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''. If the amount specified is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d), the proposal shall be deemed approved if two-thirds of the persons voting thereon shall vote ''yes''.  

In no event shall the amount specified be greater than the reduction required pursuant to said paragraph (d).  

The local appropriating authority may, by a two-thirds vote, submit two questions on the same ballot; provided that only one question shall specify an amount which is greater than one-half of the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (d). If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  

(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.

The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  

(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section.

Amounts for such capital outlay expenditures or for the city's or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit shall be assessed only after approval by a separate vote of the people taken at a regular or special election held before the setting of the annual tax rate; provided, however, that the question submitted shall be worded as follows: ''Shall the (city/town) of ___ be allowed to assess an additional $___ in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of (state the purpose(s) for which the monies from this assessment will be used) for the fiscal year beginning July first, two thousand and ___?  

Yes        No    '';

(m) A town may appropriate from the tax levy, from available funds, or from borrowing, contingent on the passage of a ballot question under paragraph (g), (i1/2) or (k), but: (1) the statement of the purpose of the appropriation shall be substantially the same as the statement of purpose in the ballot question; (2) the appropriation vote shall not be deemed to take effect until the approval of the ballot question; (3) no election at which the question appears on the ballot shall take place later than the September 15 following the date of an appropriation vote adopted at an annual town meeting, or 90 days after the date of the close of any other town meeting at which an appropriation vote was adopted; and (4) after a contingent appropriation from the tax levy, a tax rate for a town shall not be submitted for certification by the commissioner under section 23 until after a ballot question under paragraph (g), (i1/2) or (k) has been voted upon, or until the expiration of the time for holding an election at which the question appears on the ballot, whichever period is shorter.  

(n) The local appropriating authority may, by accepting this paragraph, provide that taxes may thereafter be assessed in excess of the amount otherwise allowed by this section, solely for payment, in whole or in part, of water or sewer debt service charges, including debt service charges of an independent commission, authority or district and as part of any wholesale water and sewer charges, that the board or officer responsible for determining the water and sewer charges certifies were not in fiscal year nineteen hundred and ninety-three paid by local taxes; provided, however, that water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such aggregate additional taxes assessed; and provided, further, that said additional taxes may be assessed on only residential real property as defined in section two A, notwithstanding the failure of the city or town to adopt a residential factor pursuant to section fifty-six of chapter forty, but subject to any subsequent adoption of such residential factor allowed by said section fifty-six; and provided, further, that if said additional taxes are assessed only on residential real property, aggregate residential water and sewer charges shall be reduced by the amount of any such additional taxes assessed.

Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter twenty-nine C, chapter two hundred and seventy-five of the acts of nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, or any other general or special law to the contrary, any city or town which accepts this paragraph or any independent authority, commission or district which provides water or sewer services to such city or town shall remain eligible to receive loans and grants for water pollution abatement projects or safe drinking water projects.   

Section 3A. There shall be a school building advisory board comprised of: the state auditor or a designee; the inspector general or a designee; the superintendent of the state police or a designee; the state fire marshal or a designee; the director of the Massachusetts emergency management agency or a designee; the executive director of the authority, who shall serve as the secretary to the advisory board and shall be a nonvoting member of the board; and 17 members to be appointed by and represent the following nongovernmental organizations: Massachusetts Municipal Association, Inc., Massachusetts Association of School Committees, Inc., the Massachusetts Mayors Association, Inc., Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, Inc., Massachusetts Association of Regional Schools, Inc., Massachusetts Building Trades Council, the Massachusetts chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc., Massachusetts Alliance for Small Contractors, American Council of Engineering Companies of Massachusetts, Associated Subcontractors of Massachusetts, Inc., American Institute of Architects&ndash;Massachusetts, Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, Inc., Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc., Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association Incorporated, Fire Chiefs' Association of Massachusetts, Inc. and acting jointly, the Massachusetts Teachers Association and Massachusetts Federation of Teachers. The advisory board shall assist the authority in the development of general policy regarding school building construction, renovation, reconstruction, maintenance and facility space, preservation of open space and minimization of loss of open space, thoughtful community development, cost management, adequate provisions for safety and security and shall provide technical advice and input to the authority. The advisory board shall meet at least quarterly.   

Section 1. It is the intention of the general court, subject to appropriation, to assure fair and adequate minimum per student funding for public schools in the commonwealth by defining a foundation budget and a standard of local funding effort applicable to every city and town in the commonwealth.   

 Section 10. The grant percentage for approved school projects shall be calculated based on the following formula, but no grant percentage shall be greater than 80 per cent.  

(a) The percentage the commonwealth shall pay towards an approved school facilities project shall be determined by the following formula: Base Percentage (A) |m+ Community Income Factor (B1) |m+ Community Property Wealth Factor (B2) |m+ Community Poverty Factor (B3) |m+ Incentive Percentage (C).  

(A) Base Percentage = 31 percentage points.  

(B) Ability to pay percentage points (income/wealth factor) is determined as follows:  

(1) Community Income Factor = per capita income, as determined by the department of revenue, for a municipality as a per cent of the statewide average per capita income.  

The Community Income Factor is then determined by using the chart below.   
 
Income                                                                                                            

(2) Community Property Wealth Factor = Equalized property valuation per capita as determined by the department of revenue, for the municipality as a per cent of the statewide average equalized property valuation per capita.  

The Community Property Wealth Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                                                                             

(3) Community Poverty Factor = Proportion of low income students, as determined by federal eligibility for free or reduced price lunch, for the district as a per cent of the statewide average proportion of low income students.  

The Community Poverty Factor is then determined by using the chart below.                                                     

(C) Incentive percentage points may be awarded by the authority. Incentive percentage points granted, if any, shall be in the sole discretion of the authority. The authority may issue regulations delineating the type and amounts of any such incentive percentage points; provided, however, that no individual category of incentive points shall exceed 6 additional points; and provided further, that no district shall receive more than 18 incentive percentage points. Such incentive points may be awarded for a district's use of efficient construction delivery methods; regionalization with other districts; superior maintenance practices of a district; energy efficient and sustainable design and construction; major renovation rather than building new construction; the use of model schools as adopted by the authority; and other incentives as determined by the board of the authority in order to encourage the most cost-effective and quality construction.  

(b) In the case of regional school districts, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the regional district as stated in this section. For purposes of this computation, each member city's and town's share of the total cost shall be determined by multiplying the total approved cost by the percentage of district or county capital costs that would be apportioned to such city or town in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law for capital costs incurred in the fiscal year in which the grant is approved. The amount of the total capital costs apportioned to a member city or town in any fiscal year on account of an approved school project of a regional school or county, determined in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the grant payable on account of such project in such fiscal year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the city's or town's reimbursement percentage, determined as aforesaid, multiplied by the percentage of capital costs apportioned to the city or town for such fiscal year in accordance with the applicable regional school district agreement or law, and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages so derived as the numerators for all of the member cities and towns.  

In the case of independent agricultural and technical schools, B1 and B2 shall be determined by calculating the relationship to the statewide average for each municipality of the school as stated in this section. A weighted average will then be determined for these municipalities, weighted as compared to the number of students attending the school from each member municipality, which will be used to determine the final B1 and B2 factors.  

(c) For approved school projects in districts which have a racial desegregation plan approved by the board of education not later than June 30, 2000, the reimbursement percentage shall be the sum of: (a) the percentage calculated pursuant to subsections (a) and (b); and (b) for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2006, 10 percentage points, or, for projects designated as approved school projects on or before June 30, 2012, 5 percentage points. Only new project applications which present clear and convincing evidence that the proposed school building project will promote the objectives of achieving racial balance expressed in sections 37C and 37D of chapter 71 for the students attending the new, renovated, or repaired school will be eligible for the added percentage points. The total reimbursement percentage shall in no circumstances exceed the maximum grant percentage under the first paragraph of this section.   

Section 21C. (a) Whenever used in the text of this section, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings:&mdash;

If both questions are approved by the required number of voters, then the question which requires a two-thirds vote shall apply.  

(f) in any city or town in which the total taxes assessed result in a percentage which is less than or equal to the limits imposed pursuant to paragraph (b), the total taxes assessed for any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred and two and one-half per cent of the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the commissioner of revenue; provided, however, that the total taxes assessed may be further increased by those amounts approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g); and provided further, that the total amount of taxes assessed for the then current fiscal year may be increased by an amount equal to the tax rate for the preceding fiscal year multiplied by the amount of increase in the assessed valuation of any parcel of real, or article of personal property over the assessed valuation of such property during the prior year which shall become subject to taxation for the first time, or taxed as a separate parcel for the first time during such fiscal year, or which has had an increase in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation unless such increased assessed valuation is due to revaluation of the entire city or town.  

(g) The local appropriating authority of any city or town which is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) may, by majority vote, seek voter approval to assess taxes in excess of amount allowed pursuant to said paragraph (f) by a specified amount.

The voters of the city or town, by majority vote at a referendum, may alter the purpose of a stabilization fund or authorize the assessment of such additional property taxes for another purpose. In any year in which the local appropriating authority does not vote to appropriate such amount as aforesaid, the total property tax levy for such year shall be reduced by the amount that could otherwise have been assessed, so that such additional taxes may not be assessed for any other purpose. The maximum levy limit under paragraph (f) shall not be affected by any such reduction in the levy for such year.  

(h) In a city or town, if a majority of the local appropriating authority or the people by local initiative procedure shall so require, there shall be a special election called in order to submit a question to the voters as to whether said city or town should be required to assess taxes by a specified amount below that amount allowed pursuant to this section.

(i) With regard to the referenda procedures set out in this section the local appropriating authority may direct that the questions be placed upon the official ballot at a regular city or town election or at a special election which the local appropriating authority may call at any time. The local appropriating authority may also direct that not more than three such questions be placed upon the official ballots for use in the city or town at a biennial state election, by filing with the state secretary not later than the first Wednesday of August preceding that election a copy of its vote attested by the city or town clerk.

It shall be unreasonable to so conclude if such officer or employee has disclosed in writing to his appointing authority or, if no appointing authority exists, discloses in a manner which is public in nature, the facts which would otherwise lead to such a conclusion; or

(d) Any activity specifically exempted from any of the prohibitions in any other section of this chapter shall also be exempt from the provisions of this section. The state ethics commission, established by chapter two hundred and sixty-eight B, shall not enforce the provisions of this section with respect to any such exempted activity.  

(e) Where a current employee is found to have violated the provisions of this section, appropriate administrative action as is warranted may also be taken by the appropriate constitutional officer, by the head of a state, county or municipal agency. Nothing in this section shall preclude any such constitutional officer or head of such agency from establishing and enforcing additional standards of conduct.  

(f) The state ethics commission shall adopt regulations: (i) defining substantial value; provided, however, that substantial value shall not be less than $50; (ii) establishing exclusions for ceremonial privileges and exemptions; (iii) establishing exclusions for privileges and exemptions given solely because of family or friendship; and (iv) establishing additional exclusions for other situations that do not present a genuine risk of a conflict or the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The written response shall be made via first class or electronic mail and shall:  \r\n\r\n(i) confirm receipt of the request;  \r\n\r\n(ii) identify any public records or categories of public records sought that are not within the possession, custody, or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves;  \r\n\r\n(iii) identify the agency or municipality that may be in possession, custody or control of the public record sought, if known;  \r\n\r\n(iv) identify any records, categories of records or portions of records that the agency or municipality intends to withhold, and provide the specific reasons for such withholding, including the specific exemption or exemptions upon which the withholding is based, provided that nothing in the written response shall limit an agency's or municipality's ability to redact or withhold information in accordance with state or federal law;  \r\n\r\n(v) identify any public records, categories of records, or portions of records that the agency or municipality intends to produce, and provide a detailed statement describing why the magnitude or difficulty of the request unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality and therefore requires additional time to produce the public records sought;  \r\n\r\n(vi) identify a reasonable timeframe in which the agency or municipality shall produce the public records sought; provided, that for an agency, the timeframe shall not exceed 15 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records and for a municipality the timeframe shall not exceed 25 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records; and provided further, that the requestor may voluntarily agree to a response date beyond the timeframes set forth herein;  \r\n\r\n(vii) suggest a reasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the agency or municipality to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably;  \r\n\r\n(viii) include an itemized, good faith estimate of any fees that may be charged to produce the records; and  \r\n\r\n(ix) include a statement informing the requestor of the right of appeal to the supervisor of records under subsection (a) of section 10A and the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court under subsection (c) of section 10A.  \r\n\r\n(c) If the magnitude or difficulty of a request, or the receipt of multiple requests from the same requestor, unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality such that an agency or municipality is unable to complete the request within the time provided in clause (vi) of subsection (b), a records access officer may, as soon as practical and within 20 business days after initial receipt of the request, or within 10 business days after receipt of a determination by the supervisor of public records that the requested record constitutes a public record, petition the supervisor of records for an extension of the time for the agency or municipality to furnish copies of the requested record, or any portion of the requested record, that the agency or municipality has within its possession, custody or control and intends to furnish. The records access officer shall, upon submitting the petition to the supervisor of records, furnish a copy of the petition to the requestor. Upon a showing of good cause, the supervisor of records may grant a single extension to an agency not to exceed 20 business days and a single extension to a municipality not to exceed 30 business days. In determining whether the agency or municipality has established good cause, the supervisor of records shall consider, but shall not be limited to considering:  \r\n\r\n(i) the need to search for, collect, segregate or examine records;  \r\n\r\n(ii) the scope of redaction required to prevent unlawful disclosure;  \r\n\r\n(iii) the capacity or the normal business hours of operation of the agency or municipality to produce the request without the extension;  \r\n\r\n(iv) efforts undertaken by the agency or municipality in fulfilling the current request and previous requests;  \r\n\r\n(v) whether the request, either individually or as part of a series of requests from the same requestor, is frivolous or intended to harass or intimidate the agency or municipality; and  \r\n\r\n(vi) the public interest served by expeditious disclosure.  \r\n\r\nIf the supervisor of records determines that the request is part of a series of contemporaneous requests that are frivolous or designed to intimidate or harass, and the requests are not intended for the broad dissemination of information to the public about actual or alleged government activity, the supervisor of records may grant a longer extension or relieve the agency or municipality of its obligation to provide copies of the records sought. The supervisor of records shall issue a written decision regarding a petition submitted by a records access officer under this subsection within 5 business days following receipt of the petition.

(B) shall not be assessed for the first 2 hours of work performed where the responding municipality has a population of over 20,000 people; and (C) shall not be assessed for time spent segregating or redacting records unless such segregation or redaction is required by law or approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv);  \r\n\r\n(iv) the supervisor of records may approve a petition from an agency or municipality to charge for time spent segregating or redacting, or a petition from a municipality to charge in excess of $25 per hour, if the supervisor of records determines that (A) the request is for a commercial purpose; or (B) the fee represents an actual and good faith representation by the agency or municipality to comply with the request, the fee is necessary such that the request could not have been prudently completed without the redaction, segregation or fee in excess of $25 per hour and the amount of the fee is reasonable and the fee is not designed to limit, deter or prevent access to requested public records; provided, however, that:  \r\n\r\n1. in making a determination regarding any such petition, the supervisor of records shall consider the public interest served by limiting the cost of public access to the records, the financial ability of the requestor to pay the additional or increased fees and any other relevant extenuating circumstances;  \r\n\r\n2. an agency or municipality, upon submitting a petition under this clause, shall furnish a copy of the petition to the requestor;  \r\n\r\n3. the supervisor of records shall issue a written determination with findings regarding any such petition within 5 business days following receipt of the petition by the supervisor of public records; and  \r\n\r\n4. the supervisor of records shall provide the determination to the agency or municipality and the requestor and shall inform the requestor of the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court;  \r\n\r\n(v) the records access officer may waive or reduce the amount of any fee charged under this subsection upon a showing that disclosure of a requested record is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor, or upon a showing that the requestor lacks the financial ability to pay the full amount of the reasonable fee;  \r\n\r\n(vi) the records access officer may deny public records requests from a requester who has failed to compensate the agency or municipality for previously produced public records;  \r\n\r\n(vii) the records access officer shall provide a written notification to the requester detailing the reasons behind the denial, including an itemized list of any balances attributed to previously produced records;  \r\n\r\n(viii) a records access officer may not require the requester to specify the purpose for a request, except to determine whether the records are requested for a commercial purpose or whether to grant a request for a fee waiver;

The written response shall be made via first class or electronic mail and shall:  \r\n\r\n(i) confirm receipt of the request;  \r\n\r\n(ii) identify any public records or categories of public records sought that are not within the possession, custody, or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves;  \r\n\r\n(iii) identify the agency or municipality that may be in possession, custody or control of the public record sought, if known;  \r\n\r\n(iv) identify any records, categories of records or portions of records that the agency or municipality intends to withhold, and provide the specific reasons for such withholding, including the specific exemption or exemptions upon which the withholding is based, provided that nothing in the written response shall limit an agency's or municipality's ability to redact or withhold information in accordance with state or federal law;  \r\n\r\n(v) identify any public records, categories of records, or portions of records that the agency or municipality intends to produce, and provide a detailed statement describing why the magnitude or difficulty of the request unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality and therefore requires additional time to produce the public records sought;  \r\n\r\n(vi) identify a reasonable timeframe in which the agency or municipality shall produce the public records sought; provided, that for an agency, the timeframe shall not exceed 15 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records and for a municipality the timeframe shall not exceed 25 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records; and provided further, that the requestor may voluntarily agree to a response date beyond the timeframes set forth herein;  \r\n\r\n(vii) suggest a reasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the agency or municipality to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably;  \r\n\r\n(viii) include an itemized, good faith estimate of any fees that may be charged to produce the records; and  \r\n\r\n(ix) include a statement informing the requestor of the right of appeal to the supervisor of records under subsection (a) of section 10A and the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court under subsection (c) of section 10A.  \r\n\r\n(c) If the magnitude or difficulty of a request, or the receipt of multiple requests from the same requestor, unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality such that an agency or municipality is unable to complete the request within the time provided in clause (vi) of subsection (b), a records access officer may, as soon as practical and within 20 business days after initial receipt of the request, or within 10 business days after receipt of a determination by the supervisor of public records that the requested record constitutes a public record, petition the supervisor of records for an extension of the time for the agency or municipality to furnish copies of the requested record, or any portion of the requested record, that the agency or municipality has within its possession, custody or control and intends to furnish. The records access officer shall, upon submitting the petition to the supervisor of records, furnish a copy of the petition to the requestor. Upon a showing of good cause, the supervisor of records may grant a single extension to an agency not to exceed 20 business days and a single extension to a municipality not to exceed 30 business days. In determining whether the agency or municipality has established good cause, the supervisor of records shall consider, but shall not be limited to considering:  \r\n\r\n(i) the need to search for, collect, segregate or examine records;  \r\n\r\n(ii) the scope of redaction required to prevent unlawful disclosure;  \r\n\r\n(iii) the capacity or the normal business hours of operation of the agency or municipality to produce the request without the extension;  \r\n\r\n(iv) efforts undertaken by the agency or municipality in fulfilling the current request and previous requests;  \r\n\r\n(v) whether the request, either individually or as part of a series of requests from the same requestor, is frivolous or intended to harass or intimidate the agency or municipality; and  \r\n\r\n(vi) the public interest served by expeditious disclosure.  \r\n\r\nIf the supervisor of records determines that the request is part of a series of contemporaneous requests that are frivolous or designed to intimidate or harass, and the requests are not intended for the broad dissemination of information to the public about actual or alleged government activity, the supervisor of records may grant a longer extension or relieve the agency or municipality of its obligation to provide copies of the records sought. The supervisor of records shall issue a written decision regarding a petition submitted by a records access officer under this subsection within 5 business days following receipt of the petition. The supervisor of records shall provide the decision to the agency or municipality and the requestor and shall inform the requestor of the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court.  \r\n\r\n(d) A records access officer may assess a reasonable fee for the production of a public record except those records that are freely available for public inspection. The reasonable fee shall not exceed the actual cost of reproducing the record. Unless expressly provided for otherwise, the fee shall be determined in accordance with the following:  \r\n\r\n(i) the actual cost of any storage device or material provided to a person in response to a request for public records under subsection (a) may be included as part of the fee, but the fee assessed for standard black and white paper copies or printouts of records shall not exceed 5 cents per page, for both single and double-sided black and white copies or printouts;  \r\n\r\n(ii) if an agency is required to devote more than 4 hours of employee time to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the record or records requested, the records access officer may also include as part of the fee an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce a record requested, but the fee (A) shall not be more than $25 per hour; (B) shall not be assessed for the first 4 hours of work performed; and (C) shall not be assessed for time spent segregating or redacting records unless such segregation or redaction is required by law or approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv);  \r\n\r\n(iii) if a municipality is required to devote more than 2 hours of employee time to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce a record requested, the records access officer may include as part of the fee an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the record requested but the fee (A) shall not be more than $25 per hour unless such rate is approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv); (B) shall not be assessed for the first 2 hours of work performed where the responding municipality has a population of over 20,000 people; and (C) shall not be assessed for time spent segregating or redacting records unless such segregation or redaction is required by law or approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv);  \r\n\r\n(iv) the supervisor of records may approve a petition from an agency or municipality to charge for time spent segregating or redacting, or a petition from a municipality to charge in excess of $25 per hour, if the supervisor of records determines that (A) the request is for a commercial purpose; or (B) the fee represents an actual and good faith representation by the agency or municipality to comply with the request, the fee is necessary such that the request could not have been prudently completed without the redaction, segregation or fee in excess of $25 per hour and the amount of the fee is reasonable and the fee is not designed to limit, deter or prevent access to requested public records; provided, however, that:  \r\n\r\n1. in making a determination regarding any such petition, the supervisor of records shall consider the public interest served by limiting the cost of public access to the records, the financial ability of the requestor to pay the additional or increased fees and any other relevant extenuating circumstances;  \r\n\r\n2. an agency or municipality, upon submitting a petition under this clause, shall furnish a copy of the petition to the requestor;  \r\n\r\n3. the supervisor of records shall issue a written determination with findings regarding any such petition within 5 business days following receipt of the petition by the supervisor of public records; and  \r\n\r\n4. the supervisor of records shall provide the determination to the agency or municipality and the requestor and shall inform the requestor of the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court;  \r\n\r\n(v) the records access officer may waive or reduce the amount of any fee charged under this subsection upon a showing that disclosure of a requested record is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor, or upon a showing that the requestor lacks the financial ability to pay the full amount of the reasonable fee;  \r\n\r\n(vi) the records access officer may deny public records requests from a requester who has failed to compensate the agency or municipality for previously produced public records;  \r\n\r\n(vii) the records access officer shall provide a written notification to the requester detailing the reasons behind the denial, including an itemized list of any balances attributed to previously produced records;  \r\n\r\n(viii) a records access officer may not require the requester to specify the purpose for a request, except to determine whether the records are requested for a commercial purpose or whether to grant a request for a fee waiver; and  \r\n\r\n(ix) as used in this section ''commercial purpose'' shall mean the sale or resale of any portion of the public record or the use of information from the public record to advance the requester's strategic business interests in a manner that the requester can reasonably expect to make a profit, and shall not include gathering or reporting news or gathering information to promote citizen oversight or further the understanding of the operation or activities of government or for academic, scientific, journalistic or public research or education  \r\n\r\n(e) A records access officer shall not charge a fee for a public record unless the records access officer responded to the requestor within 10 business days under subsection (b).  \r\n\r\n(f) As used in this section, ''employee time'' means time required by employees or necessary vendors, including outside legal counsel, technology and payroll consultants or others as needed by the municipality.   \r\n\r\nSection 18.

(b) If the agency or municipality does not intend to permit inspection or furnish a copy of a requested record, or the magnitude or difficulty of the request, or of multiple requests from the same requestor, unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality such that the agency or municipality is unable to do so within the timeframe established in subsection (a), the agency or municipality shall inform the requestor in writing not later than 10 business days after the initial receipt of the request for public records. The written response shall be made via first class or electronic mail and shall:

(vi) identify a reasonable timeframe in which the agency or municipality shall produce the public records sought; provided, that for an agency, the timeframe shall not exceed 15 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records and for a municipality the timeframe shall not exceed 25 business days following the initial receipt of the request for public records; and provided further, that the requestor may voluntarily agree to a response date beyond the timeframes set forth herein;  

(vii) suggest a reasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the agency or municipality to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably;  

(viii) include an itemized, good faith estimate of any fees that may be charged to produce the records; and  

(ix) include a statement informing the requestor of the right of appeal to the supervisor of records under subsection (a) of section 10A and the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court under subsection (c) of section 10A.  

(c) If the magnitude or difficulty of a request, or the receipt of multiple requests from the same requestor, unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality such that an agency or municipality is unable to complete the request within the time provided in clause (vi) of subsection (b), a records access officer may, as soon as practical and within 20 business days after initial receipt of the request, or within 10 business days after receipt of a determination by the supervisor of public records that the requested record constitutes a public record, petition the supervisor of records for an extension of the time for the agency or municipality to furnish copies of the requested record, or any portion of the requested record, that the agency or municipality has within its possession, custody or control and intends to furnish. The records access officer shall, upon submitting the petition to the supervisor of records, furnish a copy of the petition to the requestor. Upon a showing of good cause, the supervisor of records may grant a single extension to an agency not to exceed 20 business days and a single extension to a municipality not to exceed 30 business days. In determining whether the agency or municipality has established good cause, the supervisor of records shall consider, but shall not be limited to considering:  

(i) the need to search for, collect, segregate or examine records;  

(ii) the scope of redaction required to prevent unlawful disclosure;  

(iii) the capacity or the normal business hours of operation of the agency or municipality to produce the request without the extension;  

(iv) efforts undertaken by the agency or municipality in fulfilling the current request and previous requests;  

(v) whether the request, either individually or as part of a series of requests from the same requestor, is frivolous or intended to harass or intimidate the agency or municipality; and  

(vi) the public interest served by expeditious disclosure.  

If the supervisor of records determines that the request is part of a series of contemporaneous requests that are frivolous or designed to intimidate or harass, and the requests are not intended for the broad dissemination of information to the public about actual or alleged government activity, the supervisor of records may grant a longer extension or relieve the agency or municipality of its obligation to provide copies of the records sought. The supervisor of records shall issue a written decision regarding a petition submitted by a records access officer under this subsection within 5 business days following receipt of the petition. The supervisor of records shall provide the decision to the agency or municipality and the requestor and shall inform the requestor of the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court.  

(d) A records access officer may assess a reasonable fee for the production of a public record except those records that are freely available for public inspection.

(iii) if a municipality is required to devote more than 2 hours of employee time to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce a record requested, the records access officer may include as part of the fee an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the record requested but the fee (A) shall not be more than $25 per hour unless such rate is approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv); (B) shall not be assessed for the first 2 hours of work performed where the responding municipality has a population of over 20,000 people; and (C) shall not be assessed for time spent segregating or redacting records unless such segregation or redaction is required by law or approved by the supervisor of records under clause (iv);  

(iv) the supervisor of records may approve a petition from an agency or municipality to charge for time spent segregating or redacting, or a petition from a municipality to charge in excess of $25 per hour, if the supervisor of records determines that (A) the request is for a commercial purpose; or (B) the fee represents an actual and good faith representation by the agency or municipality to comply with the request, the fee is necessary such that the request could not have been prudently completed without the redaction, segregation or fee in excess of $25 per hour and the amount of the fee is reasonable and the fee is not designed to limit, deter or prevent access to requested public records; provided, however, that:

(v) the records access officer may waive or reduce the amount of any fee charged under this subsection upon a showing that disclosure of a requested record is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor, or upon a showing that the requestor lacks the financial ability to pay the full amount of the reasonable fee;  

(vi) the records access officer may deny public records requests from a requester who has failed to compensate the agency or municipality for previously produced public records;

(c) If the magnitude or difficulty of a request, or the receipt of multiple requests from the same requestor, unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality such that an agency or municipality is unable to complete the request within the time provided in clause (vi) of subsection (b), a records access officer may, as soon as practical and within 20 business days after initial receipt of the request, or within 10 business days after receipt of a determination by the supervisor of public records that the requested record constitutes a public record, petition the supervisor of records for an extension of the time for the agency or municipality to furnish copies of the requested record, or any portion of the requested record, that the agency or municipality has within its possession, custody or control and intends to furnish.

(v) whether the request, either individually or as part of a series of requests from the same requestor, is frivolous or intended to harass or intimidate the agency or municipality; and  

(vi) the public interest served by expeditious disclosure.  

If the supervisor of records determines that the request is part of a series of contemporaneous requests that are frivolous or designed to intimidate or harass, and the requests are not intended for the broad dissemination of information to the public about actual or alleged government activity, the supervisor of records may grant a longer extension or relieve the agency or municipality of its obligation to provide copies of the records sought. The supervisor of records shall issue a written decision regarding a petition submitted by a records access officer under this subsection within 5 business days following receipt of the petition.

Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau.

All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs.

These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  \r\n\r\nAll proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law.

Programs shall be sufficiently flexible to serve families with various work schedules. The department shall develop a method for funding the program, which may provide grants, or enter into contracts with any provider of early education and care, or entities coordinating or administering plans to provide high-quality, comprehensive services to children and their families within the local community. These providers may include, but are not limited to: public; private; non-profit and for-profit preschools; child care centers; nursery schools; preschools operating within public and private schools; Head Start programs; independent and system-affiliated family child care homes; and local early education and care councils.

The policy shall be research-based, and aligned with best practices. The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  \r\n\r\n(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe department shall include its findings and recommendations, and any updates of its findings, in the annual report required under section 3.   \r\n\r\nSection 2.

Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\n"", ""Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards.

In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties.

To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4.

To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9.

The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation. The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.  \r\n\r\nA provider or governmental unit aggrieved by the bureau's action or failure to act with respect to the determination of a price pursuant to the bureau's pricing methods, and desiring a review thereof, may file, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the bureau, an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals in accordance with section 4H of chapter 7. The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs. The bureau shall coordinate or conduct audits of providers as needed to monitor compliance with applicable fiscal policies. The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards. The bureau may conduct quality assurance reviews of provider financial statements and their auditors' reports and work papers. The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  \r\n\r\nThe assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  \r\n\r\nAll proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.   \r\n\r\nSection 1A.

Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21.

The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  \r\n\r\nThe prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall submit an estimated rate of inflation for social service programs to the secretary of administration and finance annually by October 1 for consideration in the preparation of the governor's annual budget recommendation.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.  \r\n\r\nThe bureau shall establish guidelines and standards, consistent with generally accepted governmental auditing standards, for independent financial and performance audits of providers of social service programs and governmental units purchasing programs.

If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law.

Programs shall be sufficiently flexible to serve families with various work schedules. The department shall develop a method for funding the program, which may provide grants, or enter into contracts with any provider of early education and care, or entities coordinating or administering plans to provide high-quality, comprehensive services to children and their families within the local community. These providers may include, but are not limited to: public; private; non-profit and for-profit preschools; child care centers; nursery schools; preschools operating within public and private schools; Head Start programs; independent and system-affiliated family child care homes; and local early education and care councils.

The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  \r\n\r\n(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe department shall include its findings and recommendations, and any updates of its findings, in the annual report required under section 3.   \r\n\r\nSection 2.

The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual.

A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7.

In order to inform the plan, the board shall conduct:  \r\n\r\n(1) an inventory and assessment of the current resources and strategies available for workforce and professional development in the commonwealth, including but not limited to Head Start trainings, community-based trainings, higher education programs, child care resource and referral agency trainings, state and federally funded workforce development trainings/programs, public school system trainings/credentialing, and other trainings that address the needs of those who work with children and make recommendations for coordinating the use of those existing resources and strategies;  \r\n\r\n(2) analyses using current data on the status of the early education and care workforce, including work experience, certifications, education, training opportunities, salaries, benefits and workplace standards; and  \r\n\r\n(3) an assessment of the workforce capacity necessary to meet the state's early education and care needs in the future.  \r\n\r\nIn the development of the plan, the board shall consider:  \r\n\r\n(1) core competencies, a common and shared body of knowledge, for all those working in the early education and care fields;  \r\n\r\n(2) streamlined and coordinated state certification, credentialing, and licensing within the early education and care fields including teacher and provider certification and licensing, the child development associate, public school teacher certification, and other program standards as appropriate for director, teacher and provider credentialing requirements;  \r\n\r\n(3) a mandatory and regularly updated professional development and qualification registry;  \r\n\r\n(4) agreements among higher education institutions for an articulated system of education, training, and professional development in early education and care;  \r\n\r\n(5) approval of early education and care training programs and academic coursework, incentives for associates and bachelors programs to meet best practices and to modify curricula to reflect current child development research, and certification of trainers and teachers;  \r\n\r\n(6) coordination of existing workforce resources among public agencies, including establishing regional workforce support resources in coordination with child care resource and referral agencies;  \r\n\r\n(7) a range of professional development and educational opportunities that provide appropriate coursework and degree pathways for family child care as well as center-based providers at all levels of the career ladder that are available in locations, days, and times that are accessible;  \r\n\r\n(8) credit for prior learning experiences, development of equivalencies to 2 and 4 year degrees, and the inclusion of strategies for multiple pathways for entry into the field of early education and care;  \r\n\r\n(9) recruitment and retention of individuals into the early education and care workforce who reflect the ethnic, racial, linguistic, and cultural diversity of Massachusetts families based on the current census data;  \r\n\r\n(10) incentives and supports for early education and care professionals to seek additional training and education, such as scholarships, stipends, loan forgiveness connected to a term of service in the field, career counseling and mentoring, release time and substitutes;  \r\n\r\n(11) guidelines for a career ladder or career lattice representing salaries and benefits that suitably compensate professionals for increases in educational attainment and with incentives for advancement, including a salary enhancement program;  \r\n\r\n(12) public and private resources to support the workforce development system;  \r\n\r\n(13) a data collection and evaluation system to determine whether the workforce and professional development activities established pursuant to this chapter are achieving recruitment, retention and quality of the workforce goals;  \r\n\r\n(14) ways to recognize and honor advancement in educational attainment among early educational and care professionals;  \r\n\r\n(15) professional development opportunities that are provided in languages other than English, and incorporation of these opportunities into any broader, articulated system that is developed; and  \r\n\r\n(16) alignment of the core competencies, course offerings and other professional development opportunities, where appropriate, with the program quality standards established under section 11.  \r\n\r\n(17) training to identify and address infant toddler and early childhood behavioral health needs.   \r\n\r\nSection 13. (a) The board shall, subject to appropriation, establish the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program to assist in providing voluntary, universally accessible, high-quality early education and care programs and services for preschool-aged children in the commonwealth. The program shall be designed to meet and enhance the preschool-aged child's ability to make age appropriate progress in the development of cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical capacities and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks.  \r\n\r\n(b) The Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall be delivered through a mixed system of providers and programs. Programs shall be sufficiently flexible to serve families with various work schedules. The department shall develop a method for funding the program, which may provide grants, or enter into contracts with any provider of early education and care, or entities coordinating or administering plans to provide high-quality, comprehensive services to children and their families within the local community. These providers may include, but are not limited to: public; private; non-profit and for-profit preschools; child care centers; nursery schools; preschools operating within public and private schools; Head Start programs; independent and system-affiliated family child care homes; and local early education and care councils. The department may provide vouchers to eligible households for the purpose of implementing the early education and care program. All providers shall demonstrate that they are willing and able to serve and integrate children of diverse abilities and special needs, diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds and diverse economic circumstances.  \r\n\r\n(c) The department and board shall, in consultation with the department and board of elementary and secondary education, develop a joint policy on kindergarten transitions, which shall ensure smooth transitions between home, family day care, center-based preschool, and public pre-school. The policy shall be research-based, and aligned with best practices. The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  \r\n\r\n(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe department shall include its findings and recommendations, and any updates of its findings, in the annual report required under section 3.   \r\n\r\nSection 2.

The collective bargaining process and the grievance procedures described in said chapter 150E including section 8 of said chapter 150E, shall not apply to the department's statutory and regulatory licensing, monitoring and enforcement functions or to the contractual arrangements and reimbursements between the department and family child care systems as defined in section 1A of chapter 15D.  \r\n\r\n(k) Collective bargaining and related activity by providers, as authorized under this section, shall qualify for the state action exemption to the federal anti-trust laws.   \r\n\r\nSection 18.

Preference may be given to projects that have suffered partial or complete damage to an eligible facility from a natural or man-made disaster.  \r\n\r\n(c) There shall be within the department a separate fund to be known as the Early Education and Out of School Time Capital Fund. The department shall administer the fund for the purpose of making grants for the development of eligible facilities for licensed early care and education and out of school time programs; provided however that the department may contract with 1 or more quasi-public or non-profit entities to administer the program, including, but not limited to, the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation established in chapter 40H.   \r\n\r\nSection 20. (a) Except as provided in section 21, all meetings of a public body shall be open to the public.  \r\n\r\n(b) Except in an emergency, in addition to any notice otherwise required by law, a public body shall post notice of every meeting at least 48 hours prior to the meeting, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.

For meetings of a county public body, notice shall be filed in the office of the county commissioners and a copy of the notice shall be publicly posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in the places as the county commissioners shall designate for the purpose.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a state public body, notice shall be filed with the attorney general by posting on a website under the procedures established for this purpose and a duplicate copy of the notice shall be filed with the regulations division in the state secretary's office.  \r\n\r\nThe attorney general may prescribe or approve alternative methods of notice where the attorney general determines the alternative methods will afford more effective notice to the public.  \r\n\r\n(d) The attorney general may, by regulation or letter ruling, authorize remote participation by members of a public body not present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the absent members and all persons present at the meeting location are clearly audible to each other; and provided further, that a quorum of the body, including the chair, are present at the meeting location. The authorized members may vote and shall not be deemed absent for the purposes of section 23D of chapter 39.  \r\n\r\n(e) A local commission on disability may by majority vote of the commissioners at a regular meeting authorize remote participation applicable to a specific meeting or generally to all of the commission's meetings. If a local commission on disability is authorized to utilize remote participation, a physical quorum of that commission's members shall not be required to be present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the chair or, in the chair's absence, the person authorized to chair the meeting, shall be physically present at the meeting location. The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  \r\n\r\n(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting.

Unless otherwise directed or approved by the attorney general, the appointing authority, city or town clerk or the executive director or other appropriate administrator of a state or regional body, or their designees, shall obtain certification from each person upon entering service and shall retain it subject to the applicable records retention schedule where the body maintains its official records. The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2.

Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  \r\n\r\n(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  \r\n\r\n(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  \r\n\r\n(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  \r\n\r\n(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs.

Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau.

The department shall develop a method for funding the program, which may provide grants, or enter into contracts with any provider of early education and care, or entities coordinating or administering plans to provide high-quality, comprehensive services to children and their families within the local community. These providers may include, but are not limited to: public; private; non-profit and for-profit preschools; child care centers; nursery schools; preschools operating within public and private schools; Head Start programs; independent and system-affiliated family child care homes; and local early education and care councils. The department may provide vouchers to eligible households for the purpose of implementing the early education and care program. All providers shall demonstrate that they are willing and able to serve and integrate children of diverse abilities and special needs, diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds and diverse economic circumstances.  \r\n\r\n(c) The department and board shall, in consultation with the department and board of elementary and secondary education, develop a joint policy on kindergarten transitions, which shall ensure smooth transitions between home, family day care, center-based preschool, and public pre-school. The policy shall be research-based, and aligned with best practices. The policy shall recognize the sensitive nature of the process for children and families, shall be designed to ensure the ongoing participation of parents and family in the process, and shall maximize all opportunities to ensure smooth transitions during the year before entering kindergarten. The process shall include, as much as is practicable, the exposure of both children and families to the kindergarten environment early and regularly in the transition process. The department shall require every preschool program receiving funding from the commonwealth to develop a local transition plan consistent with the statewide policy plan.  \r\n\r\n(d) The department, in cooperation with the executive office of health and human services, shall, to the extent practicable, assure that the programs and services provided through the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program are no less available in the aggregate to the children of disabled parents than to the children of non-disabled parents. The department of early education and care, with the approval of the board and in consultation with the state advisory committee on early education and care established in section 3A, shall study and present any additional recommendations on the programmatic, financing, and phase-in options for the development and universal implementation of the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program. This study shall include an estimate of the need for full-day, full-year care that meets the needs of parents who work full-time and shall include the number of pre-school aged children in the commonwealth who may be at risk due to family poverty, TAFDC status, special needs, or other risk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe department shall include its findings and recommendations, and any updates of its findings, in the annual report required under section 3.   \r\n\r\nSection 2.

Said chapter 150E, including subsection (c) of section 7, shall apply to family child care providers except to the extent that chapter 150E is inconsistent with this section, in which case this section shall control. In addition, family child care providers shall be treated as state employees solely for the purposes of sections 17A and 17G of said chapter 180. Family child care providers shall not be considered public employees or state employees for any purpose other than those set forth in this subsection.

Family child care providers shall not be eligible for benefits through the group insurance commission, the state board of retirement or the state employee workers' compensation program.  \r\n\r\n(c) Family child care providers who are employees of the commonwealth under this section are not, for that reason, public employees or employees of the commonwealth for any other purpose, and shall not be classified as employees of the commonwealth or as employees of family child care systems, as defined in section 1A, under section 148B of chapter 149. Nothing in this chapter shall alter the obligations of the commonwealth or the parent or legal guardian of the child receiving family child care services to provide their share of social security, federal and state unemployment taxes, Medicare and workers compensation insurance under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, federal and state unemployment law, the Massachusetts Workers Compensation Act or vicarious liability in tort.  \r\n\r\n(d) Consistent with section 9A of said chapter 150E, no family child care provider shall engage in a strike and no family child care provider shall induce, encourage or condone any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by any family child care provider.  \r\n\r\n(e) The only appropriate bargaining unit for family child care providers shall consist of all family child care providers in the commonwealth who are on the most current list provided by the commissioner, regardless of the number of hours of care such family child care providers have worked.  \r\n\r\n(f) An employee organization seeking to represent family child care providers shall file with the department of labor relations under section 4 of said chapter 150E.  \r\n\r\n(g) The mandatory subjects, as to which the department and an employee organization certified by the department of labor relations as the bargaining representative of family child care providers shall bargain, shall include developing and encouraging greater education and training opportunities for family child care providers, improvement of recruitment and retention of qualified providers and reimbursement and payment procedures.

The collective bargaining process and the grievance procedures described in said chapter 150E including section 8 of said chapter 150E, shall not apply to the department's statutory and regulatory licensing, monitoring and enforcement functions or to the contractual arrangements and reimbursements between the department and family child care systems as defined in section 1A of chapter 15D.  \r\n\r\n(k) Collective bargaining and related activity by providers, as authorized under this section, shall qualify for the state action exemption to the federal anti-trust laws.   \r\n\r\nSection 18.

Preference may be given to projects that have suffered partial or complete damage to an eligible facility from a natural or man-made disaster.  \r\n\r\n(c) There shall be within the department a separate fund to be known as the Early Education and Out of School Time Capital Fund. The department shall administer the fund for the purpose of making grants for the development of eligible facilities for licensed early care and education and out of school time programs; provided however that the department may contract with 1 or more quasi-public or non-profit entities to administer the program, including, but not limited to, the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation established in chapter 40H.   \r\n\r\nSection 20. (a) Except as provided in section 21, all meetings of a public body shall be open to the public.  \r\n\r\n(b) Except in an emergency, in addition to any notice otherwise required by law, a public body shall post notice of every meeting at least 48 hours prior to the meeting, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. In an emergency, a public body shall post notice as soon as reasonably possible prior to the meeting. Notice shall be printed in a legible, easily understandable format and shall contain the date, time and place of the meeting and a listing of topics that the chair reasonably anticipates will be discussed at the meeting.  \r\n\r\n(c) For meetings of a local public body, notice shall be filed with the municipal clerk and posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in or on the municipal building in which the clerk's office is located.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a regional or district public body, notice shall be filed and posted in each city or town within the region or district in the manner prescribed for local public bodies. For meetings of a regional school district, the secretary of the regional school district committee shall be considered to be its clerk and shall file notice with the clerk of each city or town within the district and shall post the notice in the manner prescribed for local public bodies. For meetings of a county public body, notice shall be filed in the office of the county commissioners and a copy of the notice shall be publicly posted in a manner conspicuously visible to the public at all hours in the places as the county commissioners shall designate for the purpose.  \r\n\r\nFor meetings of a state public body, notice shall be filed with the attorney general by posting on a website under the procedures established for this purpose and a duplicate copy of the notice shall be filed with the regulations division in the state secretary's office.  \r\n\r\nThe attorney general may prescribe or approve alternative methods of notice where the attorney general determines the alternative methods will afford more effective notice to the public.  \r\n\r\n(d) The attorney general may, by regulation or letter ruling, authorize remote participation by members of a public body not present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the absent members and all persons present at the meeting location are clearly audible to each other; and provided further, that a quorum of the body, including the chair, are present at the meeting location. The authorized members may vote and shall not be deemed absent for the purposes of section 23D of chapter 39.  \r\n\r\n(e) A local commission on disability may by majority vote of the commissioners at a regular meeting authorize remote participation applicable to a specific meeting or generally to all of the commission's meetings. If a local commission on disability is authorized to utilize remote participation, a physical quorum of that commission's members shall not be required to be present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the chair or, in the chair's absence, the person authorized to chair the meeting, shall be physically present at the meeting location. The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  \r\n\r\n(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the chair shall inform other attendees of any recordings.  \r\n\r\n(g) No person shall address a meeting of a public body without permission of the chair, and all persons shall, at the request of the chair, be silent. No person shall disrupt the proceedings of a meeting of a public body. If, after clear warning from the chair, a person continues to disrupt the proceedings, the chair may order the person to withdraw from the meeting and if the person does not withdraw, the chair may authorize a constable or other officer to remove the person from the meeting.  \r\n\r\n(h) Within 2 weeks of qualification for office, all persons serving on a public body shall certify, on a form prescribed by the attorney general, the receipt of a copy of the open meeting law, regulations promulgated under section 25 and a copy of the educational materials prepared by the attorney general explaining the open meeting law and its application under section 19. Unless otherwise directed or approved by the attorney general, the appointing authority, city or town clerk or the executive director or other appropriate administrator of a state or regional body, or their designees, shall obtain certification from each person upon entering service and shall retain it subject to the applicable records retention schedule where the body maintains its official records. The certification shall be evidence that the member of a public body has read and understands the requirements of the open meeting law and the consequences of violating it.   \r\n\r\nSection 5. Two attested copies of the regulations of each agency shall be filed with the state secretary together with a citation of the law by authority of which the same purport to have been issued, and together with the dates of approval by other boards or agencies if required and any other information necessary to show compliance with statutory requirements relative to issuance of such regulations. Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  \r\n\r\nNo rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  \r\n\r\n(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  \r\n\r\n(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  \r\n\r\n(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  \r\n\r\n(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  \r\n\r\nThe state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   \r\n\r\nSection 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  \r\n\r\n(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  \r\n\r\ni. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  \r\n\r\nii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  \r\n\r\niii. to speak on his own behalf; and  \r\n\r\niv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  \r\n\r\n2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  \r\n\r\n3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  \r\n\r\n4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  \r\n\r\n5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  \r\n\r\n6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  \r\n\r\n7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  \r\n\r\n8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  \r\n\r\n9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  \r\n\r\n(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  \r\n\r\n(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  \r\n\r\n10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.  \r\n\r\n(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  \r\n\r\n1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  \r\n\r\n2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;  \r\n\r\n3. before the executive session, the chair shall state the purpose for the executive session, stating all subjects that may be revealed without compromising the purpose for which the executive session was called;  \r\n\r\n4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  \r\n\r\n5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   \r\n\r\nSection 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  \r\n\r\n(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  \r\n\r\n(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  \r\n\r\n(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  \r\n\r\n(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  \r\n\r\n(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  \r\n\r\nWhen the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  \r\n\r\n(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  \r\n\r\n(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   \r\n\r\nSection 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  \r\n\r\nWhen a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  \r\n\r\nWhen, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   \r\n\r\nSection 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  \r\n\r\n(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  \r\n\r\n(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  \r\n\r\n(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  \r\n\r\n(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards.

Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services.

Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

For the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  

The bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  

The bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  

The bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers.

The prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.

The bureau shall also notify superintendents of this estimated rate of inflation by October 1.

The question on appeal of the decision of the bureau of purchased services shall be whether the bureau, in taking the action challenged by the aggrieved party, has properly applied its regulations. This paragraph shall not be construed to confer a right upon an aggrieved party to challenge, in a proceeding before the division of administrative law appeals, the procedural or substantive validity of a regulation of general applicability promulgated by the bureau of purchased services. Any such challenges shall be brought exclusively in the superior courts of the commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of chapter 30A.

The bureau shall develop and administer a uniform system of financial accounting, allocation, reporting and auditing of providers which conforms to generally accepted governmental auditing standards.

The disclosure of client records by providers to auditors, including independent auditors as defined by federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;133, as amended, as necessary to comply with state and federal audit requirements shall not constitute an invasion of privacy, or otherwise be grounds for civil or criminal penalty.  

The assistant commissioner may, in accordance with said chapter 30A, promulgate rules and regulations required to develop, implement, administer and monitor the programs and functions of the bureau. These regulations shall provide for right of appeal to the bureau or other appropriate bodies for a procuring governmental unit or provider aggrieved by an action or failure to act under this section or the regulations.  

All proposed regulations of the department of early education and care and the department of elementary and secondary education, and any other licensing or certification standards proposed by a department having an impact on chapter 71B Special Education programs, shall be forwarded to the bureau of purchased services with a statement describing the anticipated financial impact of the regulations 14 days prior to publication of the notice of rulemaking required under chapter 30A.  

The bureau shall adopt regulations limiting the reimbursement to providers for the salaries of their officers or managers to the maximum salary of Job Group M&ndash;XII in the management salary schedule in section 46C of chapter 30.  

The bureau shall adopt rules and regulations governing contracts between governmental units and social service program providers which shall include, but not be limited to: a provision requiring that all transactions between the providers and related parties shall be disclosed in writing in advance to the bureau and to such governmental units; a provision requiring a complete inventory of equipment which is to be used by a provider and to which a governmental unit has title, and requiring the return of such equipment to the proper governmental unit upon the completion or termination of the contract; and a provision requiring that any contracts for which funds expended by the commonwealth thereunder reimburse or compensate the providers for the amortization of mortgages for the ownership of any real property, whether owned directly or indirectly by a provider, shall contain provisions for the recoupment of such reimbursement or compensation by the commonwealth in the event the property is sold and may, if necessary, allow for the execution of liens to ensure such recoupment; provided, however, that any such lien shall be subordinated to a statutory lien, to the lien of a first mortgagee who has provided a purchase-money mortgage for such property and to the interest of a banking institution, as defined in section 1 of chapter 167A, holding a security interest in such property in an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the appraised value of such property as determined and provided by such banking institution; and provided further, that any such recoupment shall be net of any outstanding balance due pursuant to any such superior security interest. If after a hearing the bureau finds a violation of a regulation adopted under this paragraph, the bureau may order that the contract be terminated, or may assess a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 or 10 per cent of the amount payable under the contract, whichever is greater, which the agency shall withhold from payments otherwise due under the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law. If the bureau determines after a hearing that a provider has committed repeated willful violations of this paragraph, it may debar the provider from further state contracts but such debarment shall not be for a period longer than 5 years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider aggrieved under this paragraph may exercise any legal remedies or cause of action available to such provider under law.

(d) The attorney general may, by regulation or letter ruling, authorize remote participation by members of a public body not present at the meeting location; provided, however, that the absent members and all persons present at the meeting location are clearly audible to each other; and provided further, that a quorum of the body, including the chair, are present at the meeting location.

Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  

No rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  

Prior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  

(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  

(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  

(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  

The state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   

Section 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  

(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties.

The rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  

2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  

3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;

7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  

8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  

9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  

(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  

(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  

10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.

1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  

2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;

4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  

5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   

Section 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  

(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  

(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  

(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  

(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  

(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  

When the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

For purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  

(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   

Section 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  

When a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  

When a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  

When, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   

Section 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  

(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  

(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  

(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  

(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards. In developing the benchmarks, the department shall collaborate with pediatricians, child psychologists, and researchers within the field of child development and developmental psychology, in order to ensure that the document reflects best practices in the field and the most recent evidence provided by science relative to early childhood development.   

 Section 22N. The operational services division shall include a bureau of purchased services, hereinafter known as the bureau. The bureau shall have primary responsibility for the implementation and coordination of an efficient and accountable system of procurement, selection, special education pricing, contract administration, program monitoring and evaluation, contract compliance and post audit for any department, agency, board or commission of the commonwealth which procures or pays for social service programs from providers. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

For the purposes of this section, ''social service program'' shall mean any social, special educational, mental health, mental retardation, habilitative, rehabilitative, vocational, employment and training, or elder services program or accommodations, purchased by a governmental unit, including any program provided pursuant to chapter 71B, but excluding any program or service which is reimbursable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. ''Governmental unit'' shall mean the commonwealth and any school district or other political subdivision of the commonwealth.  

The bureau shall be headed by an assistant commissioner, who shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the secretary of administration and finance, and who shall have administrative responsibility for the bureau. The position shall be classified in accordance with section 45 of chapter 30, and the salary therefor shall be determined in accordance with section 46C of said chapter 30.  

The bureau shall be comprised of such offices as may be necessary to carry out the mission of the bureau, which may include an audit office and a unit for special education pricing.  

The bureau shall have the responsibility for prescribing the methods to be used in determining the prices to be reimbursed to providers of special education programs by governmental units. The methods prescribed by the division in determining prices shall incorporate cost containment standards and shall be fair to both governmental units and providers. All governmental units shall pay the prices developed in accordance with the methods prescribed by the bureau. Pricing for social service programs, other than special education programs, shall be set by the executive office of health and human services under chapter 118E.  

The prices determined by the bureau of purchased services, or pursuant to its methods, for programs pursuant to chapter 71B shall be set annually by the first Wednesday in February for the next fiscal year. If the bureau fails to determine the final annual prices on or before the first Wednesday in February, the prices in effect at that time shall continue to be in effect for the next fiscal year. Program prices for programs approved under said chapter 71B which are located outside of the commonwealth may be adjusted prospectively to account for rate or price adjustments authorized by the host state's rate setting body. Program prices may also be adjusted prospectively to account for unanticipated emergencies beyond the reasonable control of the provider, or to reflect costs attributable to extraordinary changes in volume, or to account for compliance with federal or state statutory or local regulatory requirements as determined by the bureau and pursuant to standards developed by the bureau. No such price may be adjusted retroactively to its effective date except to account for the results of administrative reviews, if any, as provided in the regulations of the bureau. Nothing herein shall preclude the bureau from setting a price for a new program established for the first time under said chapter 71B, or individual or sole source prices as provided in the regulations of the bureau after the first Wednesday in February of any fiscal year.

The commission shall comply with all other requirements of law.  

(f) After notifying the chair of the public body, any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body, or may transmit the meeting through any medium, subject to reasonable requirements of the chair as to the number, placement and operation of equipment used so as not to interfere with the conduct of the meeting.

Upon receipt of agency regulations prepared in accordance with this chapter, the state secretary shall accept them for filing and endorse thereon the time and date of the filing.  

No rule or regulation so filed with the state secretary shall become effective until an estimate of its fiscal effect including that on the public and private sector, for its first and second year, and a projection over the first five-year period, or a statement of no fiscal effect has been filed with said state secretary. In addition, no rule or regulation so filed, unless filed for the purposes of setting rates within the commonwealth, shall become effective until an agency has filed with the state secretary a statement considering the impact of said regulation on small business. The requirements to file small business impact statements under this section and sections 2, 3 and 5A shall be enforceable by a civil action for mandamus relief, but the sufficiency of the statement filed shall not be grounds for invalidating or staying the effect of the regulation. Said state secretary shall forthwith notify all agencies required to file rules or regulations pursuant to this section.  

Prior to the adoption of a proposed regulation, an agency shall file an amended small business impact statement, which considers, without limitation, whether any of the following methods of reducing the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses would hinder achievement of the purpose of the proposed regulation:  

(1) establishing less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(2) establishing less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(3) consolidating or simplifying compliance or reporting requirements for small businesses;  

(4) establishing performance standards for small businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the proposed regulation;  

(5) an analysis of whether the proposed regulation is likely to deter or encourage the formation of new businesses in the commonwealth; and  

(6) minimizing adverse impact on small businesses by using alternative regulatory methods.  

The state secretary shall make and publish rules and regulations, not otherwise inconsistent with law, with respect to the deadlines to be met and the form to be employed by any agency in preparing and filing regulations, hearing schedules and any other materials which the secretary may require. Compliance with such rules and regulations shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of agency regulations.   

Section 21. (a) A public body may meet in executive session only for the following purposes:  

(1) To discuss the reputation, character, physical condition or mental health, rather than professional competence, of an individual, or to discuss the discipline or dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against, a public officer, employee, staff member or individual. The individual to be discussed in such executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 48 hours prior to the proposed executive session; provided, however, that notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties. A public body shall hold an open session if the individual involved requests that the session be open. If an executive session is held, such individual shall have the following rights:  

i. to be present at such executive session during deliberations which involve that individual;  

ii. to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising the individual and not for the purpose of active participation in the executive session;  

iii. to speak on his own behalf; and  

iv. to cause an independent record to be created of said executive session by audio-recording or transcription, at the individual's expense.  

The rights of an individual set forth in this paragraph are in addition to the rights that he may have from any other source, including, but not limited to, rights under any laws or collective bargaining agreements and the exercise or non-exercise of the individual rights under this section shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the individual.  

2. To conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with nonunion personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations with nonunion personnel;  

3. To discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public body and the chair so declares;  

4. To discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices, or strategies with respect thereto;  

5. To investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints;  

6. To consider the purchase, exchange, lease or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body;  

7. To comply with, or act under the authority of, any general or special law or federal grant-in-aid requirements;  

8. To consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening;  

9. To meet or confer with a mediator, as defined in section 23C of chapter 233, with respect to any litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdiction involving another party, group or entity, provided that:  

(i) any decision to participate in mediation shall be made in an open session and the parties, issues involved and purpose of the mediation shall be disclosed; and  

(ii) no action shall be taken by any public body with respect to those issues which are the subject of the mediation without deliberation and approval for such action at an open session; or  

10. to discuss trade secrets or confidential, competitively-sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the department of public utilities pursuant to section 1F of chapter 164, in the course of activities conducted as a municipal aggregator under section 134 of said chapter 164 or in the course of activities conducted by a cooperative consisting of governmental entities organized pursuant to section 136 of said chapter 164, when such governmental body, municipal aggregator or cooperative determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business in relation to other entities making, selling or distributing electric power and energy.  

(b) A public body may meet in closed session for 1 or more of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) provided that:  

1. the body has first convened in an open session pursuant to section 21;  

2. a majority of members of the body have voted to go into executive session and the vote of each member is recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes;  

3. before the executive session, the chair shall state the purpose for the executive session, stating all subjects that may be revealed without compromising the purpose for which the executive session was called;  

4. the chair shall publicly announce whether the open session will reconvene at the conclusion of the executive session; and  

5. accurate records of the executive session shall be maintained pursuant to section 23.   

Section 22. (a) A public body shall create and maintain accurate minutes of all meetings, including executive sessions, setting forth the date, time and place, the members present or absent, a summary of the discussions on each subject, a list of documents and other exhibits used at the meeting, the decisions made and the actions taken at each meeting, including the record of all votes.  

(b) No vote taken at an open session shall be by secret ballot. Any vote taken at an executive session shall be recorded by roll call and entered into the minutes.  

(c) Minutes of all open sessions shall be created and approved in a timely manner. The minutes of an open session, if they exist and whether approved or in draft form, shall be made available upon request by any person within 10 days.  

(d) Documents and other exhibits, such as photographs, recordings or maps, used by the body at an open or executive session shall, along with the minutes, be part of the official record of the session.  

(e) The minutes of any open session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, shall be public records in their entirety and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to any of the exemptions under clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following materials shall be exempt from disclosure to the public as personnel information: (1) materials used in a performance evaluation of an individual bearing on his professional competence, provided they were not created by the members of the body for the purposes of the evaluation; and (2) materials used in deliberations about employment or appointment of individuals, including applications and supporting materials; provided, however, that any resume submitted by an applicant shall not be exempt.  

(f) The minutes of any executive session, the notes, recordings or other materials used in the preparation of such minutes and all documents and exhibits used at the session, may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety under subclause (a) of clause Twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4, as long as publication may defeat the lawful purposes of the executive session, but no longer; provided, however, that the executive session was held in compliance with section 21.  

When the purpose for which a valid executive session was held has been served, the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits of the session shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

For purposes of this subsection, if an executive session is held pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subsections (a) of section 21, then the minutes, preparatory materials and documents and exhibits used at the session may be withheld from disclosure to the public in their entirety, unless and until such time as a litigating, negotiating or bargaining position is no longer jeopardized by such disclosure, at which time they shall be disclosed unless the attorney-client privilege or 1 or more of the exemptions under said clause Twenty-sixth of said section 7 of said chapter 4 apply to withhold these records, or any portion thereof, from disclosure.  

(g)(1) The public body, or its chair or designee, shall, at reasonable intervals, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of this subsection warrant continued non-disclosure. Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.  

(2) Upon request by any person to inspect or copy the minutes of an executive session or any portion thereof, the body shall respond to the request within 10 days following receipt and shall release any such minutes not covered by an exemption under subsection (f); provided, however, that if the body has not performed a review pursuant to paragraph (1), the public body shall perform the review and release the non-exempt minutes, or any portion thereof, not later than the body's next meeting or 30 days, whichever first occurs. A public body shall not assess a fee for the time spent in its review.   

Section 10. In conducting adjudicatory proceedings, as defined in this chapter, agencies shall afford all parties an opportunity for full and fair hearing. Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies may (1) place on any party the responsibility of requesting a hearing if the agency notifies him in writing of his right to a hearing and of his responsibility to request the hearing; (2) make informal disposition of any adjudicatory proceeding by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default; (3) limit the issues to be heard or vary the procedures prescribed by section eleven, if the parties agree to such limitation or variation; and (4) allow any person showing that he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding to intervene as a party in the whole or any portion of the proceeding, and allow any other interested person to participate by presentation of argument orally or in writing, or for any other limited purpose, as the agency may order.  

When a party to an adjudicatory proceeding has the opportunity, by provision of any law or by regulation, to obtain more than one agency hearing on the same question, whether before the same agency or before different agencies, it shall be sufficient if the last hearing available to the party complies with the requirements of this chapter, and the earlier hearings need not so comply.  

When a party has the opportunity to obtain an agency hearing, followed by one or more appeals before the same agency or before different agencies, such appeals being limited to the record made at the hearing, the appeal procedure need not comply with any requirement of this chapter for the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings except paragraphs (7) and (8) of section eleven.  

When, under a provision of any law, a hearing is required only upon direction of an agency or upon request made in accordance with such provision by a person entitled to make such request, the requirements of this chapter governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings shall not apply unless and until such direction or request is in fact made.   

Section 11. The board, after holding a public hearing, shall adopt, and develop a schedule for revising, program quality standards and requirements that any early education and care program or provider shall meet. The department shall develop separate but related standards for children in the following developmental stages: infant and toddler, pre-school, early elementary and older school-age; and for additional developmental stages that the department may determine relevant based on research and best practices.  These standards and requirements shall incorporate essential elements of high-quality early education and care that promote healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes, and school readiness based on curriculum frameworks. Standards and requirements shall build upon the licensure regulations promulgated under section 8.  

(a) The standards for all developmental stages and any succeeding developmental stages adopted by the department shall be incorporated into a single document and linked by a common philosophy and consistent goals and guiding principles. This document shall also include the policy developed jointly with the department and board of elementary and secondary education required under section 13 to ensure smooth transitions between infant and toddler programs, preschool and kindergarten. The standards shall be regularly updated to reflect applicable research and best practices. The board shall submit standards and requirements, or revisions of them, to the joint committee on education and the house and senate committees on ways and means at least 60 days before adoption. The joint committee on education shall review and comment on the rules and regulations during that time period.  

(b) The board shall include, in its adoption and revision of program quality standards, a specific focus on the unique requirements and needs of preschool-aged children including, but not limited to, rigorous guidelines for preschool learning experiences. Every early education and care program or provider shall be required to meet these standards in order to participate in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program, established in section 13.  

(c) The department, with approval of the board, shall develop a consistent set of learning standards for all preschool programs in the commonwealth, to be included in the program quality standards. The standards shall be consistent with the curriculum frameworks developed by the department of elementary and secondary education, shall be research-based and shall be updated regularly to reflect best practices in the field of early education and care. The standards shall guarantee, at a minimum, that every program participating in the Massachusetts universal pre-kindergarten program shall include consultation and intervention services for children at risk for expulsion.  

(d) With the approval of the board, the department shall develop and establish a schedule for revising a comprehensive set of developmental benchmarks which may be incorporated into the quality standards, and which may be used by all early education and care programs in measuring children's developmental progress utilizing the healthy, cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and physical outcomes for developing the quality standards. In developing the benchmarks, the department shall collaborate with pediatricians, child psychologists, and researchers within the field of child development and developmental psychology, in order to ensure that the document reflects best practices in the field and the most recent evidence provided by science relative to early childhood development.   

Section 19. (a) When designing or acquiring an electronic record keeping system or database, records access officers shall, consistent with section 17 of chapter 110G, consult with their chief executive officer, chief administrative officer or the Massachusetts office of information technology pursuant to chapter 7D to ensure, to the extent feasible, that the system or database is capable of providing data in a commonly available electronic, machine readable format. Such database designs or acquisitions shall allow for, to the extent feasible, information storage and retrieval methods that permit the segregation and retrieval of public records and redacting of exempt information in order to provide maximum public access. No agency or municipality shall enter into a contract for the storage of electronic records containing public records if the contract prevents or unduly restricts the records access officer from providing the public records in accordance with this chapter.  

(b) Every agency shall provide on a searchable website electronic copies, accessible in a commonly available electronic format, of the following types of records, provided that any agency may withhold any record or portion thereof in accordance with state or federal law:  

(i) final opinions, decisions, orders, or votes from agency proceedings;  

(ii) annual reports;  

(iii) notices of regulations proposed under chapter 30A;  

(iv) notices of hearings;  

(v) winning bids for public contracts;  

(vi) awards of federal, state and municipal government grants;  

(vii) minutes of open meetings;  

(viii) agency budgets; and  

(ix) any public record information of significant interest that the agency deems appropriate to post.
